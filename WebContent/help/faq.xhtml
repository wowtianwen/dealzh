						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">Probably not. Whether you use it to pay for the whole order or just part of one, a gift card generally
							voids cash back on your purchases.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>
							<a class="helpLink">Can I check out other websites after clicking through yourHotDeal?</a>
						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">We understand that comparison shopping is important. However, surfing away from the yourHotDeal site
							during a transaction may cause tracking problems for your transactions. This can result in cash back not posting to your account. We suggest
							that once you are done comparison shopping, you return to yourHotDeal and click through to the merchant one more time and make your final
							purchase. In comparison shop, but I just open new browser tabs. That’s okay, right? Unfortunately, no. Having too many windows or tabs open can
							confuse tracking systems and award the commission to another website. Again, we suggest that you finish comparison shopping, close all other
							windows or tabs, and then click through yourHotDeal one last time for your final purchase.</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>
							<a class="helpLink"> Can I get a cash back for a pre-order?</a>
						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">Pre-Orders are not suggested if the cash back tracking is important to you as pre-orders will likely have
							issues with cash back.</div>

						</h4>

							<a class="helpLink"> Can I use a coupon that I found outside of yourHotDeal?</a>
						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">No, most coupon codes you find outside of yourHotDeal will void cash back on your purchases or negate the
							cash back tracking. With that being said, there are some merchants that may allow the "stacking" of coupons and cash back but we certainly
							advise our customers that using coupons from outside sources will void the cash back per our Terms and Conditions. Your best bet is to use any
							coupon displayed at yourHotDeal as those coupons are specifically approved for use with yourHotDeal and will not affect cash back.</div></li>


					<li><h4>
							<a class="helpLink">Can I use a coupon displayed on the merchant’s website? </a>
						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">If the offer is visible on the merchant's website then it should not interfere with your cash back.</div></li>

						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">These are usually not eligible for rebates. Be sure to check out our coupons for the merchant though. We

							However, yourHotDeal has no control over how a merchant applies or honors the coupons. As such, it is your responsibility be sure the coupon
							has been accepted before you check out. If the discount is important to you, we can suggest that you cancel the order and begin a new one.</div></li>


					<li><h4>
							<a class="helpLink"> I want to place multiple orders at a store. What is the best way to insure cash back tracking?</a>
						</h4>
						<div class="helpText leftMargin">If you are placing multiple orders at a store, you will need to have a unique click-through to that store
							from yourHotDeal for each unique order. I.E. Place your first order at the store through a yourHotDeal' store link, come back to yourHotDeal,
							click-through to the store again and place your second order, etc.</div></li>
